#### AKA Conversational Programming

## The problem is the code

I'm amazed by programming. You see, I'm a designer, but from a family of programmers. My dad in fact programmed on cards on some of the first computers there were. So massive street cred.

The problem, if you couldn't deduce by the first sentence's allusion, is that I just can't get my head around it. I learned HTML and CSS way back when in the 90's and still know and use them today in fits and spurts and some cut and paste Javascript. Over the past two decades plus, there has been a mind-boggling, horribly slapdash slog through everything from ActionScript (RIP), Director (RIP), Processing, MaxMSP to Ruby. All have come and gone like the tides. I just can't get my head around how it works. I'm not alone either.

[Here is an example of exactly the wrong way](https://guide.nannou.cc/tutorials/draw/animating-a-circle.html/) of having to animate by programming if you ask me.

[Here is a super long screed on visual programming](https://divan.dev/posts/visual_programming_go/) which, if you've ever tried it, attempts at making all the difficult math-like grammar of the above example, somewhat legible. I'm still fascinated with visual programming, but not sure if it's necessarily going in the right direction.

This leads me to believe the problem with "Learning How To Code" as we understand it is not who's learning it. Not how it's taught even. But how we make it.

## Where AI steps in

Recently (as of December 2022), great leaps and bounds have been made in the AI field, in particular with coding. You can give something like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) (OpenAI) something like "animate a ball" and it does all the example above does more or less.

Iâ€™m interested in making AI tools usable for people, and I'm interested in programming as a practice, so I thought why not design something that does both for a creative tool interface? You can observe what's going on in the black box while it does stuff for you. There is observability and trust. More importantly someone who is code-curious, but can barely string anything together can see the translation in real time. They can speak what they want, how they want, and then see it translated into something like Javascript. This also gives the novice a way to see *how* it should turn out for what they want. The novice can see the grammar constructed for them, and thus begin to learn and appreciate it, without struggling for months to create something and giving up after running into the wall too many times.

## What it could look like

The UI is very simple. You have three boxes. The two on the left are equally functional in that the user types into them and then the display on the right shows the output.

The user can then just keep adding prompts to produce more and more things, which would be displayed in (close to) real-time as the 'programme' is running.

Sometimes it takes a designer/animator/artist a while to get the right speed or movement right and fiddling with numbers isn't the best way of doing it. The user would then give a prompt to be given UI control to fine tune the speed. This slider is not part of the output but sits on top of it. It is also accesible in the prompt window as well, as indicated by the icon.

There would be a history of scrubble prompts which would give the user an indestructible command history so they can make more complex animations and procedures and be able to go back a couple of steps to see where things might have gone wrong.

## Roadmap

* GIFs or some animation/video showing what this would look like for real
* Soliciting brutal feedback from developers and Processing users
* Looking for something out there that already exists for years that already does this
* Experiment with track editor
* 3d mode designs with AI texture generation prompt
* Awesome logo

## Credit

The design makes heavy use of [IBM's Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com), where credit is due. It's pretty damn solid. Give it a whirl.

Also, this design work, and hopefully way more of my design work, is open source, so note the license. I've used innumberable bits and bobs of everything from code snippets to desktop software to plugins to vector graphics all free of charge and with largely no strings attached. So have you. So let's design in the open.
