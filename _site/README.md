## The problem is the code

I'm amazed by programming. You see, I'm a designer, but from a family of programmers. My dad in fact programmed on cards on some of the first computers there were. So massive street cred. The problem, if you couldn't deduce by the first sentence's allusion, is that I just can't get my head around it. I learned HTML and CSS way back when in the 90's and still know and sort of use them today in fits and spurts. But anything beyond some cut and paste Javascript and absolutely mind-boggling horribly slapdashery with everything from ActionScript (RIP), Director (RIP), Processing, attempts at Ruby have come and gone like the tides. Like I said, I, and many others, just can't get my head around how it works.

[Here is an example of exactly the wrong way](https://guide.nannou.cc/tutorials/draw/animating-a-circle.html/) of having to animate by programming if you ask me.

[Here is a super long screed on visual programming](https://divan.dev/posts/visual_programming_go/) which, if you've ever tried it, attempts at making all the difficult math-like grammar of the above example, somewhat legible. Often this doesn't help.

This leads me to believe the problem with "Learning How To Code" as we understand it is the code itself. Not who's learning it. Not how it's taught even. But how we make it.

## Where AI steps in

Recently (as of December 2022), great leaps and bounds have been made in the AI field, in particular with coding. You can give something like [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) (OpenAI) something like "animate a ball" and it does all the example above does more or less.

Iâ€™m interested in making AI tools usable for people, and I'm interested in programming as a practice, so I thought why not design something that does both for a creative tool interface? You can observe what's going on in the black box while it does stuff for you. There is observability and trust.
